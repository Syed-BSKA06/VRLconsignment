# VRL Consignment Tracker

This project is a web scraping tool that extracts consignment tracking information from the VRL Group website using Python. It automates the process of retrieving shipment details, making it easier for users to monitor their packages without manually visiting the website.

## Features
- Scrapes consignment tracking data from [VRL Group](http://www.vrlgroup.in/track_consignment.aspx).
- Uses `requests` to fetch web pages and `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML content.
- Extracts relevant shipment tracking details such as consignment number, delivery status, and estimated delivery date.
- Displays the tracking results in a user-friendly format.
- Can be modified to save the extracted data in CSV or JSON format for further analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VRL-Consignment-Tracker.git
   ```sh
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd VRL-Consignment-Tracker
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Requirements section.

## Usage
Run the script to fetch and display tracking details:
```sh
python vrl_scraper.py
```
Alternatively, if you are using Jupyter Notebook, open `VRL.ipynb` and execute the cells step by step.

## How It Works
1. The script sends a request to the VRL Group tracking page.
2. It fetches the HTML content of the page and parses it using BeautifulSoup.
3. Relevant tracking information is extracted using CSS selectors or XPath.
4. The extracted data is formatted and displayed in the console.

## Files
- `VRL.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the web scraping implementation with explanations.
- `vrl_scraper.py` - Python script version of the notebook for command-line execution.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies for easy installation.

## Notes
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection while running the script.
- The website structure may change over time, requiring updates to the scraping logic.
- Be mindful of the website's `robots.txt` policy to avoid violating its terms of use.
- Excessive scraping can lead to IP bans; use the script responsibly.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
- Integrate email or SMS notifications for shipment updates.
- Automate periodic tracking without manual execution.
- Store tracking history in a database for record-keeping.
